# Difficulties we faced:

## Problem 1
We faced a couple of difficulties while making this code. The first was finding an inclusive word bank (this is a lot harder than you might think). Thankfully, we managed to not only figure out that Wordle uses 
2 word banks, one for all valid guessable words and one for words that can be the answer, but we were also able to find those word banks online. 

## Problem 2
The second difficulty we faced was how to turn our base Wordle code into a cheating Wordle code. We were very confused about how to implement the word families that Absurdle uses. Through some research and insight, we 
managed to break down the families into how many words have a certain amount of letters that matched the guessed word.

## Problem 3those
Then we had difficulty trying to figure out how to give the correct feedback for each guess. Through some trial and error, we decided to split the new list up by which letter matched the place of the letter in the guess
(this will make more sense in the video). From there we took the longest list and had the code pick one word from that list to compare the guessed word to, adding a little bit more cheating to the mix. 

# Things we learned:
We learned that patience is definitely needed in coding, as are breaks. But also, we gained more experience using code to read files, and also creating and using lists. 

# Things we enjoyed
There were many fun things about this code, especially once we got into work. It was cool to see how we could recreate a game that we really like as a Python code. It was also cool to see how much we've progressed
because of this course, from knowing little to nothing about Python to being able to code an entire game. Overall, it was an interesting experience.
